1. Weather and Meteorological data from  [CAMS](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4?tab=overview) and several sources from [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset&text=ERA5). More about it in the ECMWF directory.

2. Livestock Data from the following paper: [Livestock 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018227). More about it in the livestock directory. 

3. Set of demographic data from ACS. More about it in the demographic directory.
